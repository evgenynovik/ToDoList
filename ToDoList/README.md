## ToDoList
----------------------------

The application provides you with a list of errands and other tasks as a memorization aid that you need or intend to complete.
You can interact with this application in the easy way just run "Spring Boot" then go to your browser and type "http://localhost:8080/api/todos/list". You will see the start page of this application. You must enable Internet access for your device while using this application.
The "ToDoList" uses JSP and Bootstrap as a presentation of the user interface.
The app applies some "Spring" libraries:
- Spring WEB;
- Spring Data JPA;
- Spring DevTools;
- Spring Test;

----------------------------

##### System Requirements
----------------------------

1. The application is compatible with Java 8 or higher.
2. You should have installed Maven on your computer. This build automation tool will set all libraries required  to use this application.
3. The application uses H2 as its database.But you can easy plug any database you want in "application.properties" file and add your database driver in Maven dependencies.
4. You must enable Internet access for your device while using this application.
5. I highly recommend using Spring Tool Suite (STS) that is compatible with your IDE.
